# rechtspraak-webscraper
This project is a rechtspraak-webscraper for the data systems project on the UvA, with the national police as a client. The program scrapes all shoplifting related verdicts from the website rechtspraak.nl within the timeframe 2005-2020. More specifically, it focuses on the headers "tenlastelegging" and "verdachte" as these headers were considered the most valuable for analysis.
